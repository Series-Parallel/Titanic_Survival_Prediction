# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

# 📌 Project Overview
  * Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical data).
  * Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in survival rates.
  * Trained and evaluated Random Forest
  * Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning.
  * Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# 📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle’s Titanic Challenge. It consists of:
  * Passenger features (Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, Embarked, etc.)
  * Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
  * Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  * Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)

# 📈 Results

  * The best-performing model achieved 0.78708% accuracy and a rank of #1804 on kaggle's leaderboard, with key insights on which factors influenced survival the most.
